# FountainAI: Advanced Screenplay and Fiction Writing with GPT and LIT-6B Integration

FountainAI is pioneering in screenplay and fiction writing by combining a custom GPT model developed using OpenAI's GPT builder and the LIT-6B model from Hugging Face, powered by a Strapi backend for data processing and management.

## Introduction and Goals
Our objective is to create a unique AI-powered tool for screenplay and fiction writing. This tool combines a custom GPT model for initial content generation and the LIT-6B model for advanced learning and adaptation to various writing styles.

## Project Overview
The project is built upon a synergy of three core components:
- **Custom GPT Model:** Developed using OpenAI's GPT builder for initial screenplay and fiction content generation.
- **LIT-6B Model (Hugging Face):** Utilized for advanced learning, trained with data provided by the custom GPT model.
- **Strapi Backend:** Manages data flow and formats it for training the LIT-6B model.

## Detailed Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Custom GPT Model Development
- Create a GPT model tailored for screenplay and fiction content generation.
- Implement mechanisms to capture and forward generated data to Strapi for processing.

### Phase 2: Data Processing with Strapi
- Develop Strapi backend to handle and format screenplay and fiction data from the custom GPT model.
- Set up API endpoints for efficient data transmission and processing, preparing it for LIT-6B training.

### Phase 3: LIT-6B Model Training
- Integrate the LIT-6B model from Hugging Face, which receives formatted training data from Strapi.
- Design training protocols to enhance the LIT-6B model's understanding and generation of screenplay and fiction content.

### Phase 4: Integration and Testing
- Ensure seamless interaction between the custom GPT model, Strapi backend, and LIT-6B model.
- Conduct thorough testing to assess the efficacy of the data flow and AI outputs.

### Phase 5: Deployment and Continuous Learning
- Deploy the FountainAI application with integrated AI components.
- Establish a feedback loop for continuous training and improvement of the LIT-6B model based on user interaction and data generation.

## Conclusion
FountainAI represents a groundbreaking approach in AI-assisted screenplay and fiction writing, merging custom GPT model generation with the advanced learning capabilities of the LIT-6B model. This innovative system promises a dynamic and evolving writing assistant, tailored to the unique styles of its users.
