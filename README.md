# FountainAI: Enhanced Screenplay Writing with AI

## Introduction and Goals
FountainAI revolutionizes screenplay writing by democratizing AI model training. This project enhances a classic writing app (Fountain screenplay app) with AI capabilities using Replicate and OpenAI APIs. The unique addition is the integration of Label Studio for interactive data annotation, coupled with Hugging Face Spaces for hosting AI models. The aim is to provide writers with an AI-enhanced tool for creative writing, enabling them to train specialized AI models for personalized assistance.

## Project Overview
Our primary goal is to enhance the Fountain app with intuitive AI-driven features for script analysis, suggestion, and content generation. The project's key components include:
- Refactoring the existing Fountain codebase.
- Integrating OpenAI API for advanced text processing and generation.
- Incorporating Replicate for additional AI functionalities.
- Implementing Label Studio for interactive data annotation.
- Leveraging Hugging Face Spaces for model hosting and training.

## Detailed Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Preparation and Analysis
- Review and understand the existing Fountain app codebase.
- Familiarize with the Replicate SwiftUI starter project.
- Explore OpenAI API capabilities and obtain necessary API keys.
- Set up Label Studio for data annotation.
- Understand Hugging Face Spaces for AI model hosting.

### Phase 2: Development Setup
- Create or adapt a Swift project for the existing Fountain framework.
- Ensure Swift and Objective-C interoperability via a bridging header.

### Phase 3: Core Development
- Develop `OpenAIService` in Swift for interacting with the OpenAI API.
- Seamlessly integrate Replicate API logic within the Swift codebase.
- Transition key Fountain components from Objective-C to Swift.
- Establish communication protocols with Label Studio and Hugging Face Spaces.

### Phase 4: Testing and Quality Assurance
- Conduct extensive unit and integration testing for all components.
- Test integrations with OpenAI, Replicate, Label Studio, and Hugging Face Spaces.
- Ensure data integrity and security in collaboration with Label Studio and Hugging Face Spaces.

### Phase 5: Documentation and Deployment
- Document new features, code changes, and operational guidelines.
- Deploy the updated Fountain app with integrated AI features and data annotation capabilities.

### Phase 6: Compliance and Security
- Adhere to OpenAI's usage policies, data privacy laws, and Hugging Face Spaces regulations.
- Implement robust security measures for API key management and data handling.

### Phase 7: Post-Deployment
- Address immediate post-deployment concerns.
- Strategize for continuous updates and feature enhancements.

### Training and Refining AI Models
- Utilize Label Studio for annotating screenplay data.
- Use annotated data to train AI models in Hugging Face Spaces.
- Continuously refine AI models based on user feedback and annotated data.
- Integrate and update AI models in the Fountain app.
- Maintain comprehensive documentation and ensure compliance with data standards.

## Success Metrics and Risk Management
- Seamless integration of AI features and data annotation tools.
- Enhanced user experience with personalized AI assistance.
- Continuous improvement of AI models based on user input.
- Regular data backups, robust contingency plans, and adherence to API usage limits.

# AI-Driven Rewriting Assistance Concept

## 1. Personalized Writing Assistant
- Trains on a single writer's work, adapting to their style.
- Acts as a tool for generating and refining content in the writer's voice.

## 2. Iterative Learning from Rewrites
- Learns from writer's rewrites to improve initial outputs.
- Leads to a more efficient and tailored writing assistant.

## 3. Enhanced Creative Process
- AI proposes initial ideas or drafts for writer's refinement.
- Enhances creativity and brings new perspectives.

## 4. Image Captioning Integration
- Incorporates image captioning from models like Stable Diffusion 1.5.
- Provides visual inspiration and context for rewriting.

## 5. Multi-Modal Training Approach
- Trains on both text and image captions for robust understanding.
- Helps in creating text that aligns with visual themes.

## 6. Challenges and Considerations
- Emphasizes quality control in AI and image generation.
- Balances creative inspiration with text coherence.
- Ensures alignment between text and visual content.
