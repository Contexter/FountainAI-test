# Integrated Project Plan for Fountain AI Enhancement

## Project Overview
Enhance the Fountain screenplay app with AI features using Replicate and OpenAI APIs, and implement a Strapi backend for logging interactions.

## Phase 1: Preparation and Analysis
- **Task 1**: Review the existing Fountain app codebase.
- **Task 2**: Familiarize with the Replicate SwiftUI starter project.
- **Task 3**: Understand OpenAI API capabilities and obtain necessary API keys.
- **Task 4**: Set up and configure the Strapi backend for logging.

## Phase 2: Development Setup
- **Task 5**: Create a new Swift project or add Swift files to the existing Fountain project.
- **Task 6**: Establish a bridging header for Swift and Objective-C interoperability (if needed).

## Phase 3: Core Development
### A. OpenAI Integration
- **Task 7**: Develop `OpenAIService` in Swift for OpenAI API interaction.
- **Task 8**: Implement methods for asynchronous API requests and JSON response handling.
- **Task 9**: Design and update the UI for OpenAI features.

### B. Replicate Integration
- **Task 10**: Integrate Replicate API logic into the Swift codebase.
- **Task 11**: Adapt and merge Replicate's functionalities with the Fountain app's workflow.

### C. Rewrite Objective-C to Swift
- **Task 12**: Rewrite essential components of Fountain from Objective-C to Swift.
- **Task 13**: Adapt and design the UI using SwiftUI principles.

### D. Strapi Backend Logging
- **Task 14**: Implement networking in Swift for Strapi backend communication.
- **Task 15**: Define and send log data for API interactions to Strapi.

## Phase 4: Testing and Quality Assurance
- **Task 16**: Conduct unit and integration tests for Swift components.
- **Task 17**: Test OpenAI and Replicate API integrations and UI interactions.
- **Task 18**: Validate Strapi backend logging and data security.

## Phase 5: Documentation and Deployment
- **Task 19**: Document the new features, code changes, and usage instructions.
- **Task 20**: Deploy the updated Fountain app with integrated AI features.
- **Task 21**: Monitor app performance and user feedback for post-deployment issues.

## Phase 6: Compliance and Security
- **Task 22**: Ensure compliance with OpenAIâ€™s usage policies and data privacy laws.
- **Task 23**: Implement security measures for API key storage and data transmission.

## Phase 7: Post-Deployment
- **Task 24**: Address any immediate post-deployment bugs or issues.
- **Task 25**: Plan for future updates and potential feature enhancements.

## Success Metrics
- Successful integration of AI features without disrupting core functionalities.
- Robust and secure logging of interactions.
- Positive user feedback and seamless user experience.

## Risk Management
- Regularly backup code and data.
- Prepare rollback plans in case of critical issues post-deployment.
- Monitor API usage to stay within budget and handle rate limits.
